# Correction to Stahl et al. (2008) "Matching bias in the selection task is not eliminated by explicit negations"

The published article contains some reporting errors that were due to use of an incorrect data file version for the analyses reported for Experiment 2. 
They do not affect the discussed results nor the conclusions drawn in the article. 
A correction was submitted that corrects these errors (correction_notice.pdf). 
This project provides raw data of the original paper (files exp1.dat and exp2.dat), the R code used in the reanalysis (correction_notice.Rmd and matching_correction.Rmd), and a document that reports the results of the reanalysis as well as the corrected section of the manuscript (matching_correction.pdf).
